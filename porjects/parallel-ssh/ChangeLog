2012-01-24 Andrew McNabb <amcnabb at mcnabbs.org>
	* Version 2.3
	  - Added a --inline-stdout option (issue #57).  Thanks to
	    pablo.barbachano for the patch.
	  - Added a PSSH_HOST environment variable (issue #62).
	  - Added a --version option (issues #33 and #45).
	  - Expanded the pssh man page and added man pages for all other
	    commands (issues #10 and #55).
	  - Fixed askpass on Mac OS X 10.6.7 (issue #50).
	  - Many other small fixes.
2011-02-02 Andrew McNabb <amcnabb at mcnabbs.org>
	* Version 2.2.2
	  - Fixed two crashes (issues 35 and 36).  One affects Python <= 2.5
	    and the other affects all of the scripts except pssh.
2011-01-26 Andrew McNabb <amcnabb at mcnabbs.org>
	* Version 2.2.1
	  - Fixed a crash when the -l option was used in conjunction with a
	    hosts file (issue #34).
2011-01-21 Andrew McNabb <amcnabb at mcnabbs.org>
	* Version 2.2
	  - Added a basic man page for pssh (issue #10).
	  - Fixed askpass to work correctly in the presence of non-password
	    prompts from ssh (issue #23).
	  - Updated the -O option so that it can be specified multiple times
	    (issue #25).  Thanks to soham.mehta for the patch.
	  - Fixed host file loader to give an error instead of a backtrace
	    if a file is not found.
	  - Fixed prsync's "-ssh-args" mangling of its argument (issue #24).
	    Thanks to jbyers for the patch.
	  - Fixed some variable names to appease pylint.  Thanks to solj for
	    the patch.
	  - Improved pscp to be able to copy multiple local files.  Thanks
	    to Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belon for the patch.
	  - Deprecated the PSSH_HOSTS environment variable that seems to
	    cause more problems than it's worth.
	  - Added the ability to set multiple hosts with a single -H flag
	    (issue #26). Thanks to ilya@sukhanov.net for the patch.
	  - Stopped passing "-q" to ssh by default (this masked error messages
	    and reduced usability).
	  - Removed automatic reading from stdin (deprecated in version 2.1).
	    Please use the "-I" option instead.
	  - Added meaningful exit status codes (issue #30).
	  - Other minor fixes
2010-02-26 Andrew McNabb <amcnabb at mcnabbs.org>
	* Version 2.1.1
	  - Fixed a problem causing PSSH to crash with Python 2.4.
2010-02-24 Andrew McNabb <amcnabb at mcnabbs.org>
	* Version 2.1
	  - Added support for Python 3.0 and 3.1.  Although PSSH has only
	    been lightly tested with Python 3, anything that doesn't work
		in Python 3 is officially a bug.
	  - Added a "-H" option for specifying hosts one-by-one instead of
	    or in addition to a hosts file.
	  - Added "-x" and "-X" options for passing extra command-line
	    arguments to ssh and rsync.  Also added a "-S" option to prsync
		for the special case of passing extra arguments to ssh
		(issue #2).
	  - Added a "-I" option for specifying that pssh should read from
	    standard input, and added a deprecation warning when standard
		input is used without this option (issue #12).
	  - Made the command argument optional when the "-I" option is
	    given, so a script can be passed to pssh on standard input
		(issue #5).
	  - If a username or port is given, these are now included in the
	    output filename, which allows different connections to be
		distinguished from each other (issue #7).
	  - Added the pssh-askpass wrapper as a standalone script because
	    setup.py was removing the executable bit from askpass.py.  This
		fixes a "permission denied" error when using the -A option
		(issue #8).
	  - Fixed a problem where pssh was unnecessarily specifying a
	    username (issue #14).
	  - Fixed a delay due to a lost SIGCHLD signal.
	  - Removed extra spaces between output chunks in outdir files
	    (issue #6).  Thanks to knutsen for the fix.
	  - Fixed a bug where pscp passed the wrong option for sending scp
	    a custom port.  Thanks to Jan Rafaj for the patch.
	  - Fixed prsync to send the port as an option to ssh (issue #1).
	    Thanks to Ryan Brothers for the fix.
2009-10-20 Andrew McNabb <amcnabb at mcnabbs.org>
	* Version 2.0
	  - Rewrote communication code to be more efficient.  PSSH now
	    operates with only one or two threads.
	  - Added the ability to interrupt PSSH (with CTRL-c).
	  - Added an option to prompt for a password.
	  - Refactored code into a distinct library (psshlib).
2008-10-12 Brent N. Chun <bnc at theether.org>
	* Version 1.4.3
	  - Fixed bug in select_wrap.  If timeout is None (e.g., the
	    default for prsync, etc.), then never time out.  Bug reported
	    by Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belon (carenas at sajinet.com.pe).
	  - Catch getopt exceptions and print usage as well as getopt
	    exception string.  Contribution from Carlo Marcelo Arenas
	    Belon (carenas at sajinet.com.pe).
	  - Added contribution from Bas van der Vlies (basv at sara.nl)
	    to allow comments in hosts file.  Comments must begin with
	    # character (leading whitespace is also allowed).
	  - Restore file status bugs after reading stdin in pssh.
	  - Fixed typo bug in pslurp when using options and in
	    non-recursive mode.
	  - Removed conflicts with built-in names.
2008-09-01 Brent N. Chun <bnc at theether.org>
	* Version 1.4.2
	  - Fixed minor bug: select returns select.error on an error,
	    not OSError.
2008-08-27 Brent N. Chun <bnc at theether.org>
	* Version 1.4.1
	  - Removed broken SIGCHLD handler.
	  - Refining subprocess _cleanup dynamically to an empty lambda
	    function since subprocess is not thread-safe and we already
	    call wait on child processes ourselves anyway.
	  - Adding missing verbose flag to rest of bin/* programs.
2008-08-24  Brent N. Chun <bnc at theether.org>
	* Version 1.4.0
	  - Fixed 64-bit bug in pslurp, pscp, prsync.  Previously, the
	    default select timeout was sys.maxint, but this is a 64-bit
	    value on 64-machines. Now using None when calling select when
	    there is no timeout.  Bug reported by (buixor at gmail.com).
	  - Catching EINTR and ignoring it for select, read, write in
	    BaseThread class.
	  - Fixed longopts for pnuke, prsync, pscp, pslurp, pssh (bug
	    reported a Debian user via Andrew Pollock (apollock at
	    debian.org)).
	    Reference: "bug #481901: pssh: options mis-specified"
	  - Added missing environment variables for options for pnuke,
	    prsync, pscp, pslurp, pssh.

	    brownman.org)
	    * Added ANSI color to pssh, pscp, etc. output.
	    * Each status message now includes a timestamp.
	    * Failures now indicate the cause (e.g., timeout, etc.)
	    * Intermediate directories are created as needed for output.
	    * Removed use of setsid in shell exec.
	    * Using Exception objects rather than raw strings.
