Installing PSSH
===============

PSSH is supported on Python 2.4 and greater (including Python 3.1 and
greater).

If you don't already have setuptools installed:

  # wget 'http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py'
  # sudo python ez_setup.py

Then:

  # sudo python setup.py install

Share and enjoy!


Instructions for Packagers
--------------------------

Packagers create RPM or deb files for Linux distributions.  If you are a
normal user, please skip this section.

Packaging PSSH is pretty straightforward.  Just do a setup.py install, and
then move usr/bin/pssh-askpass to usr/libexec/pssh/pssh-askpass.  Although
having pssh-askpass in /usr/bin doesn't really hurt anything, it's not
necessary, so it's cleaner to move it to /usr/libexec.
